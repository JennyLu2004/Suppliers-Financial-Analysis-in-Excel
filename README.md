# Suppliers-Financial-Analysis-in-Excel

The Excel file contains yearly and monthly sales information of sports suppliers from 2018 to 2024. In this project, my task involves performing financial metrics on the given data such as: 
- Year-on-Year Growth
- Market Shares
- Profit YTD
- Profit MAT
And using pivot tables and pivot charts to retrieve insights into the sales information by Supplier, Brand, Catergory, Year, etc.

Some tools and formulas/calculations used:
- Used SUMIFS to find Profit YTD and Profit MAT
- Used % of Row Total on Year to calculate market shares by Year
- Used % of Difference From previous year and Conditional Formatting to identify the Year-on-Year growth from 2018 through 2024
- Utilized pivot tables to create pivot charts and slicers to get further insights
- Data formatting
